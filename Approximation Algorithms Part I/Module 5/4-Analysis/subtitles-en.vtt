[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:15.910
Now that we have designed an algorithm for
multiway cut, we need to analyze it.

3
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.920
First, it is clear that our
algorithm runs in polynomial time.

4
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.240
Also, clear that it outputs
a proper multiway cut.

5
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.490
So the question is,
how good is the output?

6
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.750
How good is the output?

7
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.060
The value of the objective is
the sum of every edge, of cuv

8
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.900
times 1, if and only if,
the edge crosses the cut.

9
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.270
So, our algorithm is randomized.

10
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.890
As usual, we look at the expected
value of the output.

11
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.940
By linearity of expectation, we can invert
the summation and the expected sign.

12
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.960
So, the expected value of the output is
the sum of every edge in the graph of

13
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.990
cuv times the expected value of
the random variable, which is 1,

14
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.460
if and only if, the edge crosses the cut.

15
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.770
So what does this give us?

16
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.390
The probability that uv is in the output.

17
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.310
You should be used to this by now.

18
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.600
We have already used
this trick several times.

19
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.990
The linearity of expectation is very,

20
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.600
very good to enable us to
treat things independently.

21
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.980
So because of that, all we need to
do is focus on the particular edge,

22
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.820
uv, in the graph.

23
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.540
A particular pair of vertices, u and v.

24
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.260
And look at the probability that uv,
edge uv, is in the output cut.

25
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.040
So, we can forget about
the rest of the embedding.

26
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.140
Just think about u and v.

27
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.150
Now, remember how our rounding works.

28
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.920
Our rounding,

29
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.650
in the case of k equal to three, chooses
a random order of the three terminals.

30
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.080
Let's call a the first terminal, b,
the second one, c, the third one.

31
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.380
It's easy in the case of k equal to 3,
easier to use these kind of notations.

32
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.830
So in the case of a drawing,
u belongs to the first ball centered at a.

33
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.220
v belongs to the third part centered at c,
and

34
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.850
therefore, will have to pay the cost
cuv because edge uv crosses the cut.

35
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.950
What is the condition, in general,
for uv belonging to the output?

36
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.410
Well, either the first ball,

37
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.080
the green ball, contains exactly
one of the two vertices, u and v.

38
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.548
That is, either the radius r,
is between the min and

39
00:02:47.548 --> 00:02:54.128
the max of the two distances
from u to a and from v to a,

40
00:02:54.128 --> 00:03:00.020
or neither u nor

41
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.840
v was placed in the first ball but exactly
one of them is placed in the second ball.

42
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.400
That is, how can it be that neither u nor
v are placed in the first ball?

43
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.070
It must be that r is small.

44
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.167
r, the radius of the first ball,
is smaller than the main distance to a.

45
00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:26.480
And then, it must be that r is in between,
in terms of the second distances,

46
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.720
between the min and
the max of their distances to terminal b.

47
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.370
So these are ideal conditions.

48
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.275
uv is in the output,
if and only if, one or

49
00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:40.930
the other of these two
disjoint conditions are met.

50
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.850
So, now we need to analyze
the probability of these two conditions.

51
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.160
Let's see.

52
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.150
How can it be that ai, terminal ai,

53
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.220
is the first one to catch u or v,
and it catches exactly one of them?

54
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.870
Well, there's a particular
terminal there that is lucky.

55
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.189
It has better luck than the others.

56
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.120
Let's look at the terminal that
is closest to either u or v.

57
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.580
That is, for each terminal, let's look
at the min distance from u to ai and

58
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.050
from v to ai,
the min of these two quantities.

59
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.430
That's how big r needs to be in
order to catch at least one of them.

60
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.010
Okay, look at this for every terminal, and

61
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.250
then look at the terminal
that minimizes this quantity.

62
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.880
That's terminal l.

63
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.830
In the case of our drawing, v is quite
close to this this terminal, so that's l.

64
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:53.369
And this is the min distance
here from u or v to l.

65
00:04:53.369 --> 00:05:01.287
So, r needs to be at least as big in order
to have a chance of catching u or v.

66
00:05:01.287 --> 00:05:05.999
Okay, so if we look at terminal i,

67
00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:10.872
what are the chances that terminal i

68
00:05:10.872 --> 00:05:15.428
will get one or the other of u or v?

69
00:05:15.428 --> 00:05:22.045
First, in the random ordering,
i must precede l.

70
00:05:22.045 --> 00:05:27.731
It must precede l because if it comes
after l in the order of the terminals in

71
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:34.310
the random permutation, then l will
get first shot, will have priority.

72
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.170
And if l fails to catch them,
then i will also fail to catch them.

73
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:48.720
Now, i has no chance to catch exactly
one of them if l already didn't do it.

74
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.760
Okay.

75
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.560
So, i must have priority over l,
i must precede l.

76
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.530
Moreover, the ball centered at ai and

77
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.500
of radius r must separate u from v,
must catch exactly one of them.

78
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.370
So, they're not sufficient conditions
because other terminals might come into

79
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.730
play, but certainly, these two conditions
are necessary in order for one of the two

80
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.430
terminals to be in the ball centered
at ai and the other one to be outside,

81
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.144
caught exactly at the time when
we considered terminal ai.

82
00:06:25.144 --> 00:06:30.060
All right, so
now we know the probability of this event.

83
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.530
Why?

84
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.150
Because these two conditions, i precedes
l and this ball separates vertices u and

85
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.300
v, these two conditions,
they are independent of each other.

86
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.270
The first one, for a random ordering,
i and l play the same role.

87
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.184
The probability that i precedes
l is exactly one-half.

88
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.460
The second one, for r,
a random radius between 0 and 1,

89
00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.960
the probability that the ball centered
at ai and of radius r separates u from v

90
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.990
is the difference between the two
distances from ai to u and from ai to v.

91
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.690
So for every terminal i different from l,
we have this upper

92
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.650
bound on the probability that when we deal
with terminal i, we separate u from v.

93
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.730
Second case, i equal to l.

94
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:31.490
i equal to l, then how can it be
that when we consider terminal l and

95
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.760
throw the ball centered at l and
of radius r, we separate u from v?

96
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.970
Well, first l must not
be the last terminal,

97
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.478
because the last terminal doesn't
have a chance to draw ball.

98
00:07:44.478 --> 00:07:50.990
Okay, and then when it comes up,
its ball must separate u from v.

99
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.970
Again, these two events
are independent of one another.

100
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.050
What is the probability that
l is not the last terminal?

101
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.450
For k equal to 3, it's two-thirds.

102
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.500
We have a random permutation.

103
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.430
For k general, it's 1 minus 1 over k.

104
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.590
Then, what is the probability
that the ball separates them?

105
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.530
Again, it's the difference between
the two distances from al.

106
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:24.760
So, now we have our expressions where
we have used these joint events,

107
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.620
independent events,
multiplying probabilities, summing,

108
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.080
we can proceed together.

109
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:40.495
Together the probability that uv is in
the output is cuz of the terminal l.

110
00:08:40.495 --> 00:08:45.890
1 minus 1 over k times the difference
of distances from u and

111
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:51.090
v to al plus, for
every terminal i different from l,

112
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:57.150
the sum of 1/2 times the difference
of distances from ai to u and to v.

113
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:05.900
Now, what is nice is that here, what we
see is we almost have the entire sum.

114
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.540
So, let's do a little bit
of a calculation here.

115
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.670
Let's take part of this quantity here,

116
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:18.830
let's take 1/2 out of this,
and let's bring it in here.

117
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.920
This way we'll have a sum,
not just over i different from l, but

118
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.228
over every i, i equal to l, i different
from l, all possible terminals.

119
00:09:28.228 --> 00:09:33.085
So, the right-hand side will become
sum over all possible terminals of

120
00:09:33.085 --> 00:09:38.036
1/2 times the difference of distances,
and the left-hand

121
00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:42.604
side becomes the first part of
the expression, becomes what's left.

122
00:09:42.604 --> 00:09:47.300
That is,
1/2(1- 2/k) times this difference.

123
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.780
Okay, so now what is this?

124
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.430
The second part is nice,
the last expression.

125
00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.020
What is it?

126
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:05.008
It is the sum over i of 1/2 times the
difference between the ith coordinates,

127
00:10:05.008 --> 00:10:07.770
d l1 metric.

128
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:13.180
So, this is very close to the objective
function of the LP relaxation.

129
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.130
We are in good shape here.

130
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.310
What about the first term?

131
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:22.820
The first term, well again, we have
the difference between the l coordinates

132
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.370
of the two embedded vertices u and v.

133
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.970
So, we need to do a little bit more work.

134
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.950
For that,
we need to analyze this expression ul- vl.

135
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.160
How can we upper bound it?

136
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.020
Observe.

137
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.030
Observe, you have this triangle.

138
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:49.487
All the vertices on the triangle satisfy
the sum of the coordinates are equal to 1.

139
00:10:49.487 --> 00:10:55.250
It's true for u, it's true for v.

140
00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:02.339
So, if you look at ul- vl,
the difference between their coordinates,

141
00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:08.750
the l coordinates,
it's at most one-half of the l1 distance.

142
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.954
Why?
Well, with so many examples of this,

143
00:11:13.954 --> 00:11:18.730
imagine, for example,
that ul is 0.6, vl is 0.5.

144
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:23.762
ul- vl is 0.1.

145
00:11:23.762 --> 00:11:29.597
Even if they're as equal as
possible in the other coordinates,

146
00:11:29.597 --> 00:11:35.441
the other coordinates must sum to 0.4 for
ul, 0.5 for vl.

147
00:11:35.441 --> 00:11:42.105
For example, u could be 0.6, 0.4, 0.0.

148
00:11:42.105 --> 00:11:46.261
v could be 0.5, 0.5, 0.0.

149
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:46.973
And then what do we have?

150
00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:51.750
ul- vl is 0.1, but

151
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:58.050
the l1 distance is 0.1 plus 0.1 plus 0,
two times 0.1.

152
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.550
And actually, that's the best you can do.

153
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:07.080
ul- vl can never be more than half
of the sum of the ui's- vi's,

154
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.370
can never be more than
half of the l1 distance.

155
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.658
So let's take this upper bound and
plug it into our calculation.

156
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:21.322
Together, the probability that at uv is in

157
00:12:21.322 --> 00:12:26.632
the output is (1/2- 1/k) times (ul-

158
00:12:26.632 --> 00:12:31.410
vl) + 1/2 of the sum over i of ui- vi.

159
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.360
Replace ul- vl by half of the l1 distance.

160
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.982
Half times one-half, basically,
let's ignore the 1/k for a moment,

161
00:12:42.982 --> 00:12:46.150
half times one-half, that's one-quarter.

162
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.706
So, we have one-quarter here,
one-half there, so

163
00:12:50.706 --> 00:12:55.661
that's three-quarters,
three-quarters of the sum of i

164
00:12:55.661 --> 00:13:00.230
of ui- vi plus a little bit
left over that depends on k.

165
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:09.978
So, what we get is (3/2- 1/k)
* 1/2 of the l1 distance.

166
00:13:09.978 --> 00:13:12.970
Again, these one-halves,
these vectors of two,

167
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.038
they're kind of a bother to deal with.

168
00:13:16.038 --> 00:13:20.690
There kind of a bother, because you're
almost sure to forget one along the way.

169
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.370
It's a little bit like programming.

170
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.910
Doing this proof that this calculation,
it's a little like coding.

171
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.040
You have to be careful.

172
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.790
Every step, you have to make sure
you never forget a factor of 2,

173
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.760
otherwise your final result will be wrong.

174
00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:40.730
But the idea is still correct, but
big deal if you can't really prove it.

175
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.170
Okay, so let's put all this together.

176
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.470
The expected value of the output
is the sum of every edge

177
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.840
in the graph of cuv times the probability
that uv is in the output.

178
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.772
The probability that uv is in
the output is at most (3/2-

179
00:13:55.772 --> 00:13:59.750
1/k) * 1/2 of the l1
distance between u and v.

180
00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:05.358
Now, let's take out the 3/2- 1/k.

181
00:14:05.358 --> 00:14:07.430
And what do we get?

182
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:09.335
We get the objective function.

183
00:14:09.335 --> 00:14:12.540
We'd get exactly the objective
of the LP relaxation.

184
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.730
So we know,

185
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:19.720
by definition of the relaxation,
that that value is at most, OPT.

186
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.900
And so, what we have proved is

187
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.163
the expected value of the output
is at most 3/2- 1/k * OPT.

188
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.090
And so,
what have we proved in this analysis?

189
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.336
We've proved that by doing
linear programming and

190
00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:43.320
randomized rounding guided by the
geometric interpretation of the problem,

191
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.090
we can get the 3/2- 1/k approximation for
the multiway cut problem.

192
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.690
Now, what do we need to do next?

193
00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.530
We're going to try to do better, and

194
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.090
we're going to see the story
behind this problem.
